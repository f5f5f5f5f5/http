        <p class="lead">Anyway, now I`m going to say a little about myself. My name is Max, I`m 22 y.o., I have been learning programming since the sixth grade, I started with C and Pascal, I learned C++ in high school and took part in several competitions using C++. After a while I tried to learn Python, but it was boring to me. Now I`m studying Golang and I feel that I like it. This website is made using Bootstrap (thanks), because I don`t really understand much front-end, but I only wanted to test my Go skills, working with sql and html files. </p>
